# Predictive-Modeling-with-Logistic-Regression-and-Decision-Trees
This repository features an assignment on predictive modeling using KNIME, comparing logistic regression and decision tree models. It evaluates accuracy and the significance of predictors like price flexibility and customer type, and discusses improvements with added variables based on multiple model iterations.
